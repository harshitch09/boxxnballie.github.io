            &emsp; &emsp; The memory I chose for the project did not happen on a particular day, instead, it was a part of my life for good two years. I am talking about the time I spent with my school friends in class 11th and 12th. <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; We were a group of four friends and, all of us had joined the same tuition classes for our JEE preparations. We spent time together in school and then in the evening we went to tuition classes, every alternate day for four hours. Our classes used to end at around 8.30 in the evening. After that, all four of us used to wait - sometimes for hours - for a vacant e-rickshaw so that we could go back home together.<br>
            &emsp; &emsp; The memory is of that journey back home, those 30 minutes I spent every alternate day. It was the end of the day, no worries about homework, tuitions, exams, selection, nothing! We played music, jested and, everything was allowed apart from being disturbed. <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; In those 30 minutes, if any one of us had stress about anything or was irritated. It was the responsibility of the rest of us to lift the mood and maintain that charm and joyfulness. <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; Those days were indeed special and are the best days of my life. If given a chance to relive any of the past moments of my life, without any second thought, I would choose them.

                <span>&emsp; &emsp; The core concept for the project was to integrate two of the best storytelling formats - that is, storyboard and movies.</span>

               <span> &emsp; &emsp; In storyboard format, the viewer has control over time. How much time the viewer will take depends on her. But at the same time, storyboards lack movement which, sometimes leads to loss of engagement. <br>
                &emsp; &emsp; On the other hand, movies are in constant motion, they keep the viewer engaged. But, this format takes away the time control from the viewer. A 30 min video will run for 30 min for everybody irrespective of how much time they take to grasp it.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; Hence, to give the viewer control over time and keep them engaged, I chose the format of animated storyboards.<br>
                &emsp; &emsp; The intent was to engage the user beyond just animations. To do so, a website was the most appropriate medium. </span>
